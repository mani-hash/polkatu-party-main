For windows:

mail() doesn't seem to work

Methods tried:

1) Edit php.ini

a) For uwamp on windows:

   Location: uWamp\uWamp\bin\php\php-[version]\php_uwamp.ini


b) For usbwebserver: Not known

c) For wamp: Not known


2) Try editing php.ini

  a) Remove semicolon in front of sendmail_from = me@example.com

  b) Edit sendmail_from:

      sendmail_from = polkatu@gmail.com

c) Try changing ports:

   smtp_port= X

  Eg: smtp_port= 2525

d) Save mail logs to file:

   i) remove semi colon in front mail.log = 
   ii) Add a location (make sure web server has access to it)
     
     Eg: mail.log = "C:\php\logs\mail_logs.txt"

   iii) If webserver doesn't have access to it try the following:
       >>Run web server as admin

         OR
         
       >>Right click on files -> choose properties -> and change permissions

2) Alternative: use smtp to send mails
