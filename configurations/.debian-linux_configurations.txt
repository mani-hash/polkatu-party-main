For linux debian based distros:

mail() function doesn't seem to work 

Methods tried: 

1) Download sendmail on debian: 

   apt-get install sendmail

  location: /usr/sbin/sendmail
  Above location is a symbolic link to: /etc/alternatives/sendmail
  The second location is also a symbolic link to: /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail

2) Edit php.ini
  
  i) On system: 
     location: /etc/php/[version]/[check folders]

  ii) For Xampp or Lampp on linux:

     location: /opt/lampp/etc/php.ini

  a) remove semi_colon in front of sendmail_path = 

  b) Modify sendmail_path: 

     sendmail_path = "/usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i"

      or

     try sendmail_path = "sendmail -t -i"

  c) edit /etc/hosts and remove 127.0.1.1 hostname for mail() to work faster
          eg: 127.0.1.1       mani

  d)  Save mail logs to file:

     i) remove semi colon in front mail.log = 
     ii) Add a location (make sure web server has access to it)
     
     Eg: mail.log = "C:/opt/lampp/logs/mails_logs.txt"
    iii) If access is denied, enter in terminal:
           >>chmod 777 "mail_log_filename"
               
               or

           >>chown username "mail_log_filename"

3) Alternative: use smtp to send emails
